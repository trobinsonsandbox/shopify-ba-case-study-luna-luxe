sop_content = """SOP: Responding to 48-Hour Unfulfilled Subscription Order Alerts

Purpose:  
Ensure all unfulfilled subscription orders older than 48 hours are followed up on quickly and professionally, reducing customer dissatisfaction and refund risk.

When to Use This SOP

Use this SOP any time an alert is received from the automation system (Zapier, Slack, or email) indicating that a subscription order has gone unfulfilled for more than 48 hours.

Alerts are sent to: support@lunaluxenaturals.com

Step-by-Step Instructions

Step 1: Review the Alert

Check the escalation alert details, which include:
