**Title:** Auto-Tag Orders Based on Subscription Tier

**As a** fulfillment team member,  
**I want** subscription orders to be automatically tagged by tier (Mini, Essentials, Deluxe),  
**So that** I can identify packaging requirements and prioritize shipping accordingly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Orders are automatically tagged with the corresponding subscription tier upon creation
- [ ] Tags are visible in the order details for warehouse staff
- [ ] Tag logic is driven by product metafields or tags
