**Title:** Standard Operating Procedure for VA: Subscription Escalations

**As a** business analyst,  
**I want** to create a step-by-step procedure for handling delayed subscription orders,  
**So that** a virtual assistant can resolve issues without store owner involvement.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] SOP includes instructions for checking fulfillment status
- [ ] Email/Slack templates for contacting fulfillment and customers
- [ ] Escalation rules documented (e.g., refund after 72 hours if unshipped)
